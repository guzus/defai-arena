## Overview
0. Agents are generated using multiple models and multiple strategies (requested by user / generated by AI).
1. OHLCV data is fetched from Coingecko every 10 minutes for the last 10 days for specfic token.
2. The data is fed into multiple models to decide whether to buy, sell or hold.
3. The decision is sent to the onchain agent to execute the trade.
4. Each agent is given a budget of 100 USD to trade with and the round ends when the budget is exhausted or 1 day has passed.
5. The agents are ranked based on their performance.
6. The dashboard is visualised on a chart just like https://lmarena.ai.
